        <p>
            Confused by website terminology?
        </p>

        <p>
            If so, here’s a handy glossary (all in plain English) that’ll quickly get you up to speed and demystify the
            language of web technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you understand basic website jargon, you’ll never get intimidated or befuddled the next time a web
            designer or web developer spews techno-babble.
        </p>

        <h1>Basic Anatomy Of A Website</h1>

        <p>Let’s start by defining the various parts of a website:</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Header</h2>
            <p>
                The header is the top section of a website, where you’ll usually find the logo and the site’s navigation menu. It’s that steady, reliable part of the page that stays visible no matter where visitors click on your site.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Pre-Header</h2>
            <p>
                The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header. It’s often used to display helpful information like your contact details, business hours, special offers, or even secondary navigation links. Think of it as a small but mighty space for quick-access details that your visitors might appreciate seeing right away.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Favicon</h2>
            <p>
                A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab next to your website title. It’s usually a simplified version of your logo or brand mark. Favicons help visitors quickly identify your website when they have multiple tabs open, and they add a polished, professional look to your site.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Navigation (aka Navigation Bar or Main Menu)</h2>
            <p>
                The navigation is the set of links at the top of a website that helps visitors find what they’re looking for. These links are usually part of the header or located just below it.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
            <p>
                Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their location within a website’s hierarchy. They usually appear near the top of the page and look something like this:
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Website Content</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website content goes beyond just words.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Homepage (or home page)</h2>
            <p>
                The homepage — also called the front page or main page — is the starting point of most websites. It’s often the first page visitors see and serves as a central hub to guide them through your site.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Homepage Hero Area (aka Feature Area aka Headline Area)</h2>
            <p>
                The Homepage Hero Area is the top section of a homepage that grabs your attention and introduces the site’s primary message. It often spans the full width of the page and typically includes key elements like:
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Slider</h2>
            <p>
                A slider is a feature on a website that displays a rotating series of images, like a slideshow. The images usually slide horizontally from one to the next, though some sliders use fade effects instead.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Website Content</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website content goes beyond just words.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Alt Text</h2>
            <p>Alt text (short for “alternative text”) is a brief description added to images on a website. It serves two main purposes:</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Sidebar</h2>
            <p>
                A sidebar is the narrow vertical column that appears alongside your main website content. It’s often used to display things like advertisements, links to other content, calls to action, or a search box. Think of it as a supporting area for secondary information that complements the primary content.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Sub-Footer</h2>
            <p>
                The sub-footer is the section that appears at the bottom of a webpage—just above the main footer—and is consistent across your site. Think of it as a secondary navigation bar that provides additional points of access or contact details once visitors have scrolled through the primary content. While its content varies by site, a sub-footer typically includes elements such as:
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Footer (The "True" Footer)</h2>
            <p>
                The footer is the final, definitive section at the very bottom of a webpage. It typically contains essential legal, informational, and administrative details that are less frequently updated but are critical for compliance and user trust. Common footer contents include:
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Landing Page</h2>
            <p>
                A landing page is a specific page on your website where visitors “land” after clicking on an ad—whether it’s from Google, Facebook, or anywhere else.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Call To Action (aka CTA)</h2>
            <p>
                A call to action (or CTA) is a specific and direct request asking visitors to take a desired action. CTAs can take many forms: buttons, popups, ribbons, slide-ins, email opt-in boxes, or even a simple text link.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Above the Fold</h2>
            <p>
                “Above the fold” refers to the part of a webpage you immediately see before you start scrolling. Placing your call-to-action (CTA) above the fold ensures visitors see it right away, increasing the likelihood they’ll take action—like clicking a button or filling out a form.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Blog</h2>
            <p>
                A blog is a type of website—or a section of a larger website—that features content published as individual posts in chronological order, like journal entries in a diary.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Card Design (aka Tile Design or Grid-Based Design)</h2>
            <p>
                Card design organizes content into visually distinct “cards” or tiles, often arranged in a grid layout. Popularized by sites like Pinterest, this design style is clean, easy to scan, and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

        <h1>Additional Terminology Of Modern Websites</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>WordPress</h2>
            <p>
                WordPress powers millions of websites worldwide and is one of the most popular tools for building and managing websites.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>WordPress Page vs. WordPress Post</h2>
            <p>
                This takes a bit of explaining, so I wrote a whole piece on the similarities and differences between WordPress pages and posts, which you can find here.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Hosting</h2>
            <p>
                To have a website on the internet, it needs to be hosted on a web server. Think of hosting as the piece of land where your website “lives.” Just like you need land to build a house, you need a server to store your website’s files and make them available to people on the internet.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Caching</h2>
            <p>
                Caching is the process of storing a temporary version of a website or webpage to help it load faster. When someone visits your website, a cached version can be delivered quickly instead of forcing the browser to fetch everything from scratch.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Domain Name (aka URL)</h2>
            <p>
                A domain name is the address people type into their browser to visit a website—like Amazon.com, CNN.com, or markbrinker.com.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Domain Registrar</h2>
            <p>
                A domain registrar is where you purchase and register your domain name—kind of like getting a license plate for your car from the DMV.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>301 Redirect</h2>
            <p>
                A 301 redirect is a way to permanently send visitors (and search engines) from one URL to another. It’s often used when you update your website’s structure, change a page’s URL, or move your site to a new domain.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>404 Error Page</h2>
            <p>
                A 404 error page appears when someone tries to visit a page on your website that doesn’t exist — either because the page was deleted, the URL was mistyped, or the link is broken.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>DNS</h2>
            <p>
                DNS stands for Domain Name System. Think of it as the phone book of the internet.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>
                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it’s the standard language used to create websites and web pages. Invented in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee (the creator of the World Wide Web), HTML allows developers to structure content on a webpage using tags for elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage, CSS is what makes it look good. It controls the design—things like fonts, colors, spacing, and layout.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Website Builder</h2>
            <p>
                A website builder is an all-in-one tool that allows you to design and build a website without needing to write code. Website builders typically feature drag-and-drop editors, making them easy to use, even for those with minimal technical experience.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Mobile Responsive</h2>
            <p>
                A mobile responsive website automatically morphs to fit the shape and size of the screen it’s being viewed on—whether that’s a phone, tablet, or desktop. It uses CSS to adjust the layout, navigation, and font sizes seamlessly, so the site is easy to use and read on any device.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>SSL</h2>
            <p>
                SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. An SSL certificate encrypts the data sent between a website’s server and your browser, ensuring that hackers can’t intercept or read it.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>SEO</h2>
            <p>
                SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It’s the process of configuring your website to get free traffic from search engine results pages (often referred to as SERPs).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
            <p>
                Google Analytics is a free service from Google that provides statistics about your website—like how many visitors you’re getting, which pages they’re viewing, and how long they’re spending on each page.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Email Service Provider (ESP)</h2>
            <p>
                An email service provider (sometimes called an email management service or EMS) helps you build, manage, and communicate with your list of email subscribers.
            </p>
