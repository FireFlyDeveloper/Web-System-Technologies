        <p>
            The details are not the details. They make the design,” Charles Eames once said, and that has never stopped
            to be true. Starting to design a web page, we have to consider what it should consist of to solve the task
            set for it and be both usable and beautiful. Our today’s article is devoted right to those vital details
            that create an effective web page. Let’s briefly review what elements can be essential for a typical web
            page, what impact each element has, and how it contributes to the general user experience. Packed with
            plenty of web design examples.

            <h1>Header</h1>
            <p>
                Header is the upper (top) part of the webpage. Being the area people see before scrolling the page in
                their first seconds on the website, the header is an element of strategic importance. It is expected
                from the header to provide the core navigation around the website so that users could scan it in split
                seconds and jump to the main pages that can help them. Headers are also referred to as site menus and
                positioned as an element of primary navigation in the website layout.

            <h1>CTA Button</h1>
            <p>
                A call-to-action (CTA) button is an element of a user interface aimed at encouraging a user to take a
                certain action. This action presents a conversion for a particular page or screen (for example, buy,
                contact, subscribe, etc.). In other words, it turns a passive user into an active one. So, technically
                it can be any type of button that is supported with a call-to-action text. This type of button differs
                from all the other buttons on the page or screen due to its engaging nature: it has to catch attention
                and stimulate users to do the required action.

        <section>
            <h1>Hero Section</h1>
            <p>
                Hero section is the above-the-fold (pre-scroll area of the web page containing the element that presents
                the strong visual hook: a hero image, slider, catchy piece of typography, video, or anything else
                attracting visitors’ attention and transfers a needed message to them. Make no mistake, the term doesn’t
                require that all images of this kind should include a human, animal, mascot, or any other kind of
                character. Don’t get tricked over with that “hero” part. It can also be the product photo or the theme
                image featuring a landscape, a device, a building – anything, even an abstract model or composition. The
                main idea is that the visual hook in the hero section instantly grabs attention and allows for setting
                the quick visual, emotional, and informative connection with the users, engaging them to scroll or push
                the buttons to learn more.

            <h1>Footer</h1>
            <p>
                Footer is the lower (bottom) part of the web page which usually marks its end. Being another common zone
                of global website navigation, the footer provides the additional field for useful links and data users
                may be interested in finding.

            <h1>Slider</h1>
            <p>
                Slider is an interactive element that applies a technique of a slideshow or carousel to present
                different products, offers, etc. It is especially popular as a part of e-commerce and business websites
                to present a sort of gallery of products or services.

        <section>
            <h1>Search</h1>
            <p>
                Internal search is a functionality that enables a visitor to browse the content inside the website and
                shows it according to the search query. Tuned correctly, it shows the relevant content, and this way
                provides the shortcut to what the user needs. Thus, the internal search saves the user’s time and
                effort, amplifies usability and desirability of the digital product, helps retain users, and increases
                conversion rates. The interactive element responsible for the internal search in the user interface is a
                search field, also called a search box or search bar: it enables a user to type in the search query and,
                this way find the pieces of content that are needed.

            <h1>Menu</h1>
            <p>
                The menu is one of the core navigation elements in user interfaces. It is a graphical control that
                presents the options of interactions with the interface. Basically, it can be the list of commands – in
                this case, options will be presented with verbs marking possible actions like, for example, “save,”
                “delete,” “buy,” “send,” etc. A menu can also present the categories along which the content is
                organized in the given interface, and this can be the high time for using nouns marking them.

        <section>
            <h1>Breadcrumbs</h1>
            <p>
                Breadcrumbs are navigation elements used to support users in a journey around the website: they get
                aware of where they are on the website and can get used to the website structure more easily. So,
                breadcrumbs present a tool for better wayfinding, yet, they don’t replace the primary navigation menu;
                they present the secondary level of navigation and increase website usability in case it has lots of
                pages.

        <section>
            <h1>Form</h1>
            <p>
                Form is an interactive element that allows users to send information to the system or server. In a
                nutshell, it is a digital version of any real paper form we have to fill in to provide someone with the
                arranged information; however, digital forms can have more options and functionality to make this
                process even more smooth, clear, and user-friendly. As it is a traditional and well-recognized pattern
                of collecting the data, users deal with forms quite often in their digital lives, starting from the
                process of registration, adding personal or financial details, making payments, sending feedback,
                subscribing to a newsletter, etc.

            <h1>Cards</h1>
            <p>
                Cards, also called tiles, are layout elements that help arrange and visualize homogeneous data or
                content in a scannable and easy-to-use way. Cards are usually organized in a sort of grid, but each card
                looks like a separate piece in this system. Cards can combine different types of content about a
                particular item. For example, a product preview card on a catalog page can include an image, a title,
                basic functionality of adding it to a shopping cart or saving to the wishlist, etc.

        <section>
            <h1>Video</h1>
            <p>
                Video is not a really basic part of a web page, but with the progress of web development solutions and
                technical abilities, we can find it more and more often on the website of different kinds these days. As
                mentioned in the article about video content in UX design, a catchy video crafted with an understanding
                of the target audience is a tool attracting customers’ attention as well as a well-checked method of
                informing them quickly and brightly. Video content activates several channels of perception – audio,
                visual, motion – simultaneously, and usually does that wrapped in telling a story. Such a combination of
                factors often makes a video presentation strong, emotional, and memorable.

            <h1>Progress Indicator</h1>
            <p>
                Progress indicator is a small but helpful element that helps the visitor to understand the current point
                in the general volume of information or set of actions. It is beneficial on the pages loaded with text
                content and supposing long scrolling, like long-read articles or guides, for example. Due to this
                indicator, users don’t get lost and can estimate the time needed for reading or browsing better.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">

        <section>
            <h1>Favicon</h1>
            <p>
                Favicon, also known as URL icon or bookmark icon, is a special type of symbol representing the product
                or brand in the URL-line of the browser and in the bookmark tab. It allows users to get a quick visual
                connection with it while they are browsing. This interface element proved itself effective for
                productive website promotion and good recognizability of its visual identity. Being super small, it
                makes a great contribution to web usability.

        <section>
            <h1>Tags</h1>
            <p>
                That’s another element of secondary navigation level, often found in blogs and websites with plenty of
                homogenous content. Tag is presented with a keyword or phrase that enables users to jump directly to the
                items marked up with it. Tags are actually pieces of metadata that provide quick access to specific
                content categories, so they support navigation with the additional way of content classification.
                Moreover, tags are often the elements that users create by themselves, so they become an alternative to
                the names of categories that are fixed by the website and can’t be changed by users.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">

        </section>

        <p>
            The choice of the elements to add to a specific web page should be based on the harmonic combination of user
            goals and business goals behind it as well as it’s crucial to test the solutions and update them on the
            basis of the feedback from real interactions. Sure, this article was just an introduction to the anatomy of
            a web page, so keep up with new posts in Tubik Blog to dive into more details.
